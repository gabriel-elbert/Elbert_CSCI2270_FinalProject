Project Summary
------------------------
My project is a ticketing system that allows the user to buy a train ticket and ride a train. The program starts by reading in a file listing all of the stops in the route, and storing them as a linked list of structs (Stations). The program uses system time as a random thread to determine which Station will be the user's starting point. The user may only change stations by buying a ticket. Once the prequisite has been met, the user may choose to view their boarding pass and relevant information, and ride the train. After the user's locatin has been changed, the system outputs the estimated travel time and distance traveled, and deletes their ticket.

How to Run
---------------
 int main() is located in main.cpp. This is where the file should be run from.
After entering your name, use the menu options to run different parts of the program.

Dependencies
---------------------
This program reiles on stations.csv to run properly

System Requirements
--------------------------
Just an FYI, the program was written and compiled in Visual Studio CE 2012
I have included a .zip with everything needed to run on in the VS IDE. The main.cpp, Railroad.cpp, and Railroad.h are included to run in whichever IDE you choose.
